# digitalGeometryProcessing
- This project is about make an extension of lab's delivered computer graphics framework Projective Dynamics and ShapeOp.
- Our proposal is to implement a realistic kinematics limb movement simulation on a spider mesh.
- In addition, I realized a simple walking gate controlled by cosine signals, the computing efficiency is high enough
to fufill the need of real-time rendering.
